  <p>Depression is Real and i consider it to be a pandemic in the world. When my grandmother died in 2005 I fell into a deep depression because it was the first time that I, Miguel Taveras, felt this type of way. Two years later i decided to get professional help and seek therapy and it changed my life for the better!</p>

  <p>Its important to be kind to people and not disrespect anyone because everyone is fighting their own battles and some people are silent about them. Choose your words carefully when talking to someone, you dont know what he or she are going through and dont want to make it worse. Alot of people suffer from Mental Health problems and are quiet about it. Very few seek the help they need.Its important as a society we help each other and work to make the world a better place. This pandemic of 2020 affected people from all walks of life. Be Kind!</p>
